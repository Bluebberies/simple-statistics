/**
 * The [Harmonic Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean) is
 * a mean function typically used to find the average of rates.
 * This mean is calculated by taking the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean
 * of the reciprocals of the input numbers.
 *
 * This is a [measure of central tendency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency):
 * a method of finding a typical or central value of a set of numbers.
 *
 * This runs on `O(n)`, linear time in respect to the array.
 *
 * @param {Array<number>} x sample of one or more data points
 * @returns {number} harmonic mean
 * @throws {Error} if x is empty
 * @throws {Error} if x contains a negative number
 * @example
 * harmonicMean([2, 3]).toFixed(2) // => '2.40'
